        	<p> This poster was designed using Adobe Illustrator, this was my first time using illustrator, I found it very easy to get used to and had no problems with it. The poster itself was designed for a sports gym, it is suppose to potray the face of somebody that is really getting into their workout. </p>

        	<img src="images/stamp.PNG" width="300" height="200" alt=""/> 
            	<p> As a part of my Studio Photography module, I was asked to design a postage stamp. I designed the above stamp using Photoshop, The idea was to give a modern day representation of education, our stamps could not have any words. In my stamp you can see the profile of a woman with a graduation cap on. The fact that it is a woman represents equality and change. Connected to the cap are different elements such as family etc. </p>
